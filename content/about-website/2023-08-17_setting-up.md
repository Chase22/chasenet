title = "Setting up the website"
+++

Given that I was born in the 1996 in rural germany, with limited access to the internet, i never actually experienced the "golden age" of the internet. I found myself thrown into a rapidly growing and rapidly commercialised internet. 

My interest in retro technology and listening to people that have experienced the early days of the internet I found 
myself missing what I missed. Random webpages thrown together by people that barely knew what they were doing. 
Throwing stuff together not because their SEO told them to, but because they wanted to.

Also having worked in professional Web Development before I got frustrated at the complexity and the amount of overhead 
websites required to be set up and run. I never set up my own website because i always felt like my skills were inadequate. 
I'm not a designer, I don't know how to make a website look good, how to market it, how to get people interested and I 
really don't want to have to deal with that.

Then someone randomly linked me to Neocities and the Yesterweb. A community of people tired of the modern web. 
I lost myself in scrolling through random websites. People just putting up a presence, talking about their interest.

So i said fuck it. Inspired by sadgrls website and the layout builder I threw together this website. 
It's not yet original, it's pretty much just sadgrls layout with a different font. But it doesn't have to be. Because [this is a motherfucking website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)
