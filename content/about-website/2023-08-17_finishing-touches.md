Now calling a website that has a TODO list and 2 under construction sections "finished" might be a bit ambitious,
but what I mean is that I'm now happy with how everything looks. The blogging works. I have a guestbook.
I got a new background and custom colors (thanks to the [coolors palette generator](https://coolors.co/generate)).

The banner still needs to be fixed and for some reason there's this thing

Seems to be a problem with comment box, which I want to replace with my own solution asap. But everything works more 
or less, it's somewhat responsive and I know what to do next
