    The website is build using the Zola static site generator. I mostly use it to make writing blog posts easier and allow me to structure the website into individual files.
    HTML still has no way of including other html without resorting to ugly js solutions or frameworks that load more html at runtime.
    Zola allows me to have everything structured into nice, reusable files and get it all compiled together before uploading, meaning everything you see is clean simple html.
</p>
<p>
    All the source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Chase22/chasenet" target="_blank">github</a>.
    I will probably upload snapshots somewhere else in the future in case people don't want to deal with git.

<p>
    The layout was created using <a href="https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/" target="_blank">sadgrl's Layout Builder</a>. <br/>
    I will continue to customize the layout and colors
</p>

    The used font is <a href="https://www.dafont.com/pixel-operator.font" target="_blank">Pixel Operator</a>
